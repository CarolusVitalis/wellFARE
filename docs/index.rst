WellFARE
==========

WellFARE (well Fluorescence Analysis for Reporter Experiments) is a Python library implementing the methods for growth rate, promoter activity and protein concentration from fluorescence and absorbance data, obtained for instance in a microplate experiment. In addition, the library provides practical tools for the treatment of data from reporter experiments, such as automatized outliers removal, data synchronization, and parsing of Excel files generated by the TECAN Infinite Pro microplate reader.

WellFARE has been developped in team Ibis (INRIA, France) and is licenced under the LGPL. The source code is on Github_
